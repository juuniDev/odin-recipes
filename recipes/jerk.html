            <h2>Description</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <p>After years of studying culinary arts in Europe, I returned to Jamaica in 1969 to begin work as a hotel manager with my husband, Hartmut. We were asked to manage a wonderful resort called Goblin Hill in Portland. It was an idyllic setting, and we developed a reputation for having the finest food on that side of the island.</p>
                <p>On our way to work each day we passed by a jerk stand —primitive, oh, so primitive—in Boston Beach. Now, you must remember that back then jerk cooking had none of the popularity it enjoys today. One day, when I saw the jerk stand, I said to my husband, "Willinsky, let us re-create this whole feeling at the hotel—the jerk pork, the beer, the music, the people." So we instituted Sunday afternoon parties where we served rum punch and Boston Beach jerk to hotel guests.</p>
                <p>Charles and Tony, our jerk experts, would prepare the seasoning the night before, using my Aunt Becky's finger-licking recipe. She had the most wonderful jerk spice combination, which she would pound in a mortar and slather over her pork and chicken. On Sunday, the meat was grilled in a billowing cloud of aromatic smoke. A piece of zinc roofing loosely covered the grill, capturing the smoke and helping to keep the meat moist. It is the aromatic flavor of smoke, combined with the secret combinations of spices, that captivates. Now, I will share with you some of my secret recipes.</p>
                <p>Some people find marinades more convenient to use than spice pastes.</p>
                <p>This marinade is thicker than most marinades. The flavor may strike you as a bit harsh when you first make it, but I assure you, the flavors will blend and mellow as the meat cooks.</p>
                <p>This is an excellent marinade for chicken, beef, or pork.</p>

            <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 yellow onion, finely chopped ½ cup finely chopped scallions 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
                    <li>I teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon ground Jamaican allspice</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>1 habanero, jalapeño, or serrano chili, chopped</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar</li>

            <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>To increase the heat of this rather mild marinade, add hot pepper sauce. If you want less heat, remove the seeds and ribs of the chilies before grinding them.</li>
                    <li>In a blender or food processor, combine all the ingredients and process until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Store leftover marinade in the refrigerator in a tightly closed jar for about 1 month.</li>
                
                </ol>
