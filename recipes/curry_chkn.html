                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <div class="description">
                        <p>Americans like to think of America as a melting pot. But if they ever set foot on Trinidad and Tobago, they'd marvel at how so small a nation can be so vibrantly diverse. Curried chicken is a prime example.</p>
                        <p>Obviously, curry is an East Indian staple; and the chicken, rather than pork or beef, a nod to the many Hindu and Muslim Trinbagonians for whom those meats are haram, or forbidden. The rest of the ingredients I include-the culantro-heavy green seasoning, house spice from my mom's kitchen, and the omnipresent peppa sauce-round out the dish, while the potatoes add starchy balance and serve as repositories of flavor.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul class="ingredients">
                        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
                        <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
                        <li>1½ cups Green Seasoning</li>
                        <li>4 tablespoons Curry Powder</li>
                        <li>1½ teaspoons House Spice</li>
                        <li>4 chicken leg quarters</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons grapeseed oil, plus more as needed</li>
                        <li>1 quart Chicken Stock</li>
                        <li>1 red Scotch bonnet pepper</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons Peppa Sauce</li>
                        <li>3 large Yukon Gold potatoes (about 1½ pounds), peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes</li>

                    </ul>
                
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol class="steps">
                        <li>Combine the salt, onions, green seasoning, curry powder, house spice, and chicken in a large bowl. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.</li>
                        <li>When ready to cook, add 2 tablespoons of oil to a large pot over high heat. When it shimmers, sear the chicken until deeply golden brown on both sides, about 4 minutes in total.</li>
                        <li>Remove to a plate and set aside. Add ½ cup chicken stock to the pot, stirring to scrape up any browned bits, then return the chicken to the pan. </li>
                        <li>Add any remaining marinade, the Scotch bonnet (leaving it whole), peppa sauce, and the rest of the chicken stock.</li>
                        <li>Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer gently, uncovered, for 1 hour.</li>
                        <li>Remove the chicken to a plate. Add the potatoes to the pot, cover partially, and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, until just tender. </li>
                        <li>Add up to ½ cup water as needed to keep saucy while the potatoes cook.</li>
                        <li>Remove and discard the Scotch bonnet (being careful not to puncture it), then return the chicken to the pot.</li>
                        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning, then serve with Perfectly Steamed Rice</li>
                        <li>Curried chicken will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 months.</li>
