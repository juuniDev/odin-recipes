        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In my Jamaican home, the kitchen was our heartbeat, where flavors united our family. The previous Jamaican Rice and Peas version here missed the mark on the true cultural essence. Today, I proudly share my mom's recipe.</p>
        <p>Jamaican rice and peas, a soulful creation with thyme, scallion, and garlic, embodies the island's spirit. Picture Sundays, the kitchen alive with this masterpiece and baked chicken. Earthy notes from pimento seeds and a gentle warmth from Scotch bonnet pepper define its charm. Scotch bonnet peppers, a constant in our kitchen, add a subtle, fruity undertone. Use them whole for a milder heat. Habanero pepper works as a substitute.</p>
        <p>Gungo peas "("Pigeon peas")" are used in this recipe but red kidney beans are a good substitute. The coconut milk, tinged with bean hues, gives the rice its signature blush.</p>
        <p>For a taste of authentic Jamaican rice and peas, here's the cherished recipe.</p>
