        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>In my Jamaican home, the kitchen was our heartbeat, where flavors united our family. The previous Jamaican Rice and Peas version here missed the mark on the true cultural essence. Today, I proudly share my mom's recipe.</p>
            <p>Jamaican rice and peas, a soulful creation with thyme, scallion, and garlic, embodies the island's spirit. Picture Sundays, the kitchen alive with this masterpiece and baked chicken. Earthy notes from pimento seeds and a gentle warmth from Scotch bonnet pepper define its charm. Scotch bonnet peppers, a constant in our kitchen, add a subtle, fruity undertone. Use them whole for a milder heat. Habanero pepper works as a substitute.</p>
            <p>Gungo peas (or pigeon peas) are used in this recipe but red kidney beans are a good substitute. The coconut milk, tinged with bean hues, gives the rice its signature blush.</p>
            <p>For a taste of authentic Jamaican rice and peas, here's the cherished recipe:</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup dried gungo peas, rinsed, soaked overnight, and drained</li>
                <li>3 cups water</li>
                <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 scallions, finely chopped</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>5 allspice berries</li>
                <li>5 thyme sprigs</li>
                <li>1 Scotch bonnet pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>1 (13.5-ounce) can unsweetened coconut milk</li>
                <li>2 cups long-grain white rice</li>
            </ul>

    
        <h2>Steps</h2>     
            <ol>
                <li>Gather your ingredients.</li>
                <li>In a large saucepan, cover the beans with the water and bring to a boil over moderately high heat. Stir in the onion, scallions, garlic, allspice, thyme, Scotch bonnet, ginger, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.</li>
                <li>Stir in the coconut milk and bring to a simmer.</li>
                <li>Cover and simmer over low heat until the beans are tender, about 1 hour; adjust the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer.</li>
                <li>Stir in the rice; cover and simmer over low heat until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove from the heat and let steam for 10 minutes, then discard the thyme stems, allspice berries, and Scotch bonnet. Using a fork, fluff the rice and beans and season with salt.</li>
                <li>Serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
